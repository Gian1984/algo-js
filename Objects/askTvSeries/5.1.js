/* Exercise 5.1
Create a function named askTvSerie() that will ask the user for the 
following data about its favorite TV serie:

Name
Production year
Names of the cast members (there can be as much as the user want)
That function must gather all the data in a single object and return it.
 The data structure must be elegant.

Create a program that use that function to generate a TV serie object 
and display it to the user in JSON format.
